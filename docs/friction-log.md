# Friction Log — Moldable Development Tracker

**Rule:** When a pattern appears **3 times**, we build the domain object or view for it.

Each entry captures what question was being answered, how many files had to be read to answer it, and what would have made it instant.

Reference designs (build when friction justifies): [v031-MOLDABLE-DEV-SPEC.md](../v031-MOLDABLE-DEV-SPEC.md)
