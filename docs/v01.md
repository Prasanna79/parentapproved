We don't need ad-free playback, we can use the **YouTube IFrame Embed API**, which is:
- Officially supported and sanctioned by YouTube's ToS
- Works on any device with a WebView, no sign-in needed
- Gives us full JavaScript control over the player
- No Google account on the TV whatsoever

The TV app becomes radically simple:

```
TV app does exactly two things:
1. Shows a native grid of approved video thumbnails (from Supabase)
2. Loads youtube.com/embed/{videoId} in a WebView (youtube-nocookie if we don't have a cookie)

The WebViewClient blocks ALL navigation. Period.
Kid taps a related video thumbnail at end of video? Blocked.
Kid taps the YouTube logo? Blocked.
Kid taps a channel name? Blocked.
Kid taps anything that isn't the play/pause/progress bar? Blocked.

The ONLY way a new video loads is when OUR native code 
tells the WebView to load the next approved video ID.
```

For the prototype
No sign-in on the TV. No cookies or imported from laptop. 

This also means the embed parameters do the rest of the work:

```
youtube.com/embed/{videoId}
  ?autoplay=1          // start playing
  &rel=0               // don't show related videos
  &modestbranding=1    // minimal YouTube branding
  &iv_load_policy=3    // no annotations
  &controls=1          // show play/pause/progress
  &disablekb=0         // remote can pause/play
  &fs=0                // no fullscreen button
  &playsinline=1       // play inline
  &enablejsapi=1       // we get player events (ended, paused, etc.)
```

And then the WebViewClient is just a whitelist:

```kotlin
override fun shouldOverrideUrlLoading(view, request): Boolean {
    // Block EVERYTHING. Our native code handles all navigation.
    return true  // true = "I handled it" = nothing happens
}
```

That's it. One line. The kid literally cannot go anywhere. The only URLs that ever load are the ones our app explicitly calls `webView.loadUrl()` for.

Show a few video links to load, and in each we test for this.
