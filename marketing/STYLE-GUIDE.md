# ParentApproved.tv — Marketing Style Guide

## Who We're Talking To

**Primary persona: The Overwhelmed Curator**

She's 28-38. She has a kid (or kids) between 2 and 10. She works — maybe full-time, maybe part-time, maybe she's managing a household that *is* full-time work. She has an Android TV device because it was affordable and does the job.

She's not anti-screen. She uses screens strategically — to cook dinner, take a work call, or just breathe for 20 minutes. She doesn't need anyone to tell her screens are bad. She already knows the trade-offs. She's making the best call she can with the time and energy she has.

**What she's actually thinking:**
- "I'm fine with him watching videos. I just want to pick which ones."
- "I don't have time to sit next to her every time she watches TV."
- "YouTube is a minefield. He starts on dinosaur videos and ends up on... I don't even know what."
- "I looked into YouTube Kids. It's better but it still shows stuff I wouldn't choose."
- "I feel guilty enough already. I don't need another app telling me I'm doing it wrong."

**What she's NOT thinking:**
- "I need an open-source, local-first architecture with NewPipeExtractor."
- "I wonder what the API rate limits are."
- "I should set up a VPN to my home network."

She doesn't care how it works. She cares that it works, that she can trust it, and that setup doesn't eat her entire Saturday.

## Voice & Tone

### The Voice: Parent Who Codes

We sound like a parent who happens to be good with technology — not a tech company that happens to make a parenting product. The founder built this for their own kids first. That's the energy.

**We are:**
- **Direct.** Say what it does. Don't dress it up.
- **Warm but not soft.** Empathetic, not saccharine.
- **Confident without bragging.** We know this is good. We don't need to shout.
- **Honest about limitations.** "This is beta" is a trust signal, not a weakness.
- **Respectful of her time.** Every sentence earns its place or gets cut.

**We are NOT:**
- **Corporate.** No "leverage," "empower," "solution," "ecosystem."
- **Preachy.** We don't lecture about screen time. She's heard it.
- **Patronizing.** We never imply she's doing it wrong.
- **Fearmonger-y.** We don't lead with horror stories. We lead with what she can do.
- **Jargon-heavy.** No "sideload" without explaining it. No "APK" without context.
- **Salesy.** No countdown timers, no "limited spots," no fake urgency.

### Tone Spectrum

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Hero / headline | Confident, clear, almost quiet |
| Problem section | Honest, empathetic, no drama |
| How it works | Practical, step-by-step, reassuring |
| Differentiators | Proud but understated |
| FAQ | Conversational, direct |
| Error states / edge cases | Honest, helpful, never blame the user |
| Social media | Relatable, lightly humorous, human |
| GitHub / technical docs | Separate voice — technical, precise (not covered here) |

## Messaging Principles

### 1. Empowering, Not Alarming

**The core reframe:** The problem isn't that she lets her kids watch videos. The problem is that she can't control which videos. We give her that control back.

- **Yes:** "You're the best person to decide what your kids watch."
- **Yes:** "No algorithm knows your child like you do."
- **No:** "46% of kids are exposed to DANGEROUS content!" (stat is true, framing is wrong)
- **No:** "Are YOUR kids safe online??" (fearmongering)

Use the stat. Don't weaponize it. The difference:

> **Alarming:** "Nearly half of children have seen inappropriate content on YouTube. Is your child next?"
>
> **Empowering:** "46% of parents say their kids have seen something inappropriate on a video app — even with parental controls on. That's why we built something where you pick every video."

### 2. No Guilt. Ever.

She already feels guilty about screen time. 70% of parents do. Our job is to remove guilt, not add it.

- **Yes:** "Let them watch. You already approved every video."
- **Yes:** "Screen time you don't have to worry about."
- **No:** "Are you monitoring what your children watch?"
- **No:** "Don't let your kids watch unsupervised!" (implies she's negligent)

The most powerful thing we can say is: **what you're already doing is fine — here's a tool that makes it even better.**

### 3. Simple Over Clever

She's scanning the page between making lunch and answering a work email. She doesn't have time for wordplay.

- **Yes:** "You pick the videos. They watch only those."
- **Yes:** "No ads. No algorithm. No surprises."
- **No:** "Reimagining the future of curated family entertainment experiences."
- **No:** "Where algorithmic boundaries meet parental intentionality."

One-syllable words beat three-syllable words. Short sentences beat long ones. If a 12-year-old wouldn't understand it, rewrite it.

### 4. Honest About What This Is (and Isn't)

Beta is a trust signal when paired with honesty. It says: "we're real people building something real, and we're not pretending it's finished."

- **Yes:** "This is a beta. Some things are rough. Your feedback shapes what we build."
- **Yes:** "Currently works with YouTube playlists. More video sources planned."
- **Yes:** "The Home button exits the app — that's an Android limitation we can't fix."
- **No:** "The ultimate parental control solution for every family!"
- **No:** "Never worry about screen time again!"

### 5. She Decides, Not Us

We never position ourselves as the authority on her child's viewing. She is the authority. We're the tool.

- **Yes:** "You curate. We play."
- **Yes:** "We don't pick content. We don't filter content. We don't recommend content. You do."
- **No:** "Our AI-powered safety engine ensures appropriate content."
- **No:** "Trusted by thousands of families." (not yet, and this positions us as the authority)

## Language Rules

### Words We Use

| Instead of... | We say... |
|---------------|-----------|
| User | Parent, you |
| Child/children (clinical) | Kid, kids, your kid |
| Content (vague) | Videos, playlists |
| Solution | App, tool |
| Empower | Let you, give you control |
| Leverage | Use |
| Curated experience | Videos you picked |
| Onboarding | Setup, getting started |
| Monetization | We don't charge for this |
| Proprietary | Ours (but we say "open source") |
| Sideload (alone) | Install the app (with explanation: "outside the Play Store") |
| APK (alone) | App file / APK (the app file) |

### Words We Avoid Entirely

- **Synergy, ecosystem, platform, solution, leverage, optimize, engagement**
- **Revolutionary, game-changing, disruptive, cutting-edge**
- **Unlock, unleash, supercharge**
- **Military metaphors:** "deploy," "target," "arsenal of tools"
- **Surveillance language:** "monitor," "track," "spy" — even if technically accurate. Say "see what they watched" not "monitor their activity."

### YouTube™ Usage

Per trademark guidelines:
- Always use as a descriptive reference: "Works with YouTube™ playlists"
- Never use as part of our identity: not "Safe YouTube" or "YouTube for kids"
- Include ™ on first use per page, plain text after
- Footer disclaimer on every page: *"Not affiliated with YouTube or Google LLC."*

### Technical Terms → Plain English

| Technical | On the landing page |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Local-first architecture | Everything runs on your TV |
| Embedded Ktor server | Your TV runs a tiny web server |
| NewPipeExtractor | Plays videos without needing a YouTube account |
| WebSocket relay | A secure connection between your phone and TV |
| Sideloading | Installing an app outside the Play Store |
| APK | The app file you download |
| Room database | Saved on your TV |
| Bearer token auth | You stay logged in |
| SharedFlow | (never mention) |
| ExoPlayer | (never mention — just "video player") |

## Emotional Register

### The Feeling We Want

When she finishes reading the landing page, she should feel:

1. **Relieved.** "Oh, this is exactly what I wanted. Someone already built it."
2. **Respected.** "They didn't talk down to me. They didn't try to scare me."
3. **Confident.** "I can set this up. It's not complicated."
4. **Trusting.** "There's a real person behind this. It's open source. It's free. What's the catch? — Oh, there isn't one."

### The Feeling We Must Avoid

1. **Judged.** "Great, another thing telling me I'm a bad parent."
2. **Overwhelmed.** "This seems like a lot of steps. I'll do it later." (She won't.)
3. **Suspicious.** "Why is this free? What are they really doing with my data?"
4. **Excluded.** "This is for tech bros, not for me."

## Visual Style (Brand Direction)

### Color Palette

**Primary:**
- White / off-white background (#FAFAFA)
- Near-black text (#1A1A1A) — not pure black, warmer
- Forest green CTA (#22A559) — trustworthy, not aggressive

**Accent:**
- Warm gray (#6B7280) — secondary text
- Soft blue (#3B82F6) — links
- Light sage (#F0FDF4) — callout backgrounds

**NOT:**
- Rainbow / primary colors (that's the kid UI, not the parent page)
- Corporate blue (#0066CC)
- Alarm red (we're not scaring anyone)
- Neon anything

### Typography

- **Headlines:** Bold sans-serif. Inter, DM Sans, or similar. Clean, modern, not playful.
- **Body:** Regular weight, 18px minimum. Generous line height (1.6+).
- **Tone through typography:** Professional but approachable. Not a law firm, not a nursery.

### Photography / Imagery

- **Real screenshots** of the actual app. Not mockups, not renders.
- **If showing people:** Diverse families. Not stock-photo-perfect. Not staged.
- **If showing kids watching TV:** From behind/side. Cozy, relaxed. Not "zombie child staring at screen."
- **If showing a parent's phone:** Show the dashboard with playlists visible. Real data, not "Lorem ipsum."

**Image rules:**
- No perfectly styled homes (her house has toys on the floor)
- No "worried parent" stock photos (we're not a pharma ad)
- No kids in peril imagery (we're empowering, not alarming)
- The TV should look normal — a regular living room, not a showroom

### Layout

- **Lots of whitespace.** She's scanning, not studying.
- **One idea per screen** (on mobile scroll).
- **Big touch targets.** She's holding a phone in one hand and a toddler in the other.
- **No popups.** No newsletter modals. No cookie banners (we have no cookies).

## Channel-Specific Guidelines

### Landing Page (parentapproved.tv)
- Maximum formality: **4/10** (conversational, not casual)
- Write at a **6th grade reading level**
- Every section should be scannable in 3 seconds
- CTA above the fold on mobile

### Reddit (r/Parenting, r/Mommit, r/AndroidTV)
- Write as the founder, not the brand
- First person: "I built this because..."
- Match the subreddit's tone — vulnerable in r/Parenting, technical in r/AndroidTV
- Never sound like an ad. If it reads like an ad, rewrite it.
- Engage with comments personally

### Social Media (if/when)
- **Instagram:** Screenshot + short caption. "What my kid's TV looks like now vs. before."
- **TikTok:** 30-second "before and after" — YouTube rabbit hole vs. curated playlist
- **Facebook groups:** Only share when organically relevant. "Someone asked about YouTube alternatives — here's what I built."
- Never post unprompted in mom groups. It gets flagged as spam immediately.

### Email (update notifications)
- Subject lines: plain, specific. "ParentApproved.tv update: remote access is here" not "You Won't BELIEVE What We Built!"
- Maximum 1 email per month
- Every email has an unsubscribe link (obviously)
- Tone: brief update from one parent to another

### GitHub README
- **Separate voice.** Technical, precise, developer-facing.
- Can use jargon freely (Ktor, ExoPlayer, NewPipeExtractor)
- Still human — not academic
- Link to parentapproved.tv for the non-technical explanation

## Copy Patterns (Templates)

### Feature Description Pattern
```
[What it does — one sentence, plain English]
[Why that matters to her — one sentence, her perspective]
```

Example:
> **Add playlists from your phone.** Paste a YouTube™ playlist URL on the dashboard. It shows up on the TV instantly — no need to touch the remote.

### Comparison Pattern
```
[Other product]: [what it does wrong, matter-of-fact]
ParentApproved.tv: [what we do instead]
```

Example:
> YouTube™ Kids: An algorithm picks what plays next.
> ParentApproved.tv: You pick what plays. Period.

### Objection-Handling Pattern (FAQ)
```
Q: [The actual question she'd ask, in her words]
A: [Direct answer first. Then context if needed. No hedging.]
```

Example:
> **Q: Is sideloading safe?**
> A: Yes. Sideloading just means installing an app outside the Play Store — it's a standard Android feature. Our code is open source — you (or anyone you trust) can read every line on GitHub.

### Social Proof Pattern (when we have it)
```
"[Specific thing that happened]" — [First name], mom of [age]
```

Example:
> "My 4-year-old used to end up on weird unboxing videos within 10 minutes. Now he watches the science playlist I picked and that's it." — Priya, mom of two

**Never:** "This app changed our family's life!" (too vague, too grand)

---

## The One Rule

Before publishing any piece of marketing copy, read it and ask:

> **"If an exhausted mom with 10 seconds of attention read this, would she feel respected, curious, and confident she could set this up — or would she feel judged, confused, or sold to?"**

If it's the latter, rewrite it.
