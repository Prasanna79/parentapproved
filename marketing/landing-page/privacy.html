      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 22, 2026</p>

      <div class="privacy-content">
        <h2>We Collect Nothing.</h2>
        <p>
          ParentApproved.tv is built with a single, uncompromising principle: <strong>your family's privacy is sacred.</strong>
          Most apps are built to collect data. ParentApproved.tv is built to prevent it.
        </p>

        <h3>1. No Accounts</h3>
        <p>
          You don't need an account to use ParentApproved.tv. No email address, no password, no Google sign-in.
          The app works from the moment you install it. We don't know who you are, and we don't want to.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Local-First Storage</h3>
        <p>
          Everything stays in your home. Your playlists, your watch history, and your settings are stored in a
          local database on your Android TV. This data is never uploaded to any server or cloud service.
        </p>

        <h3>3. No Analytics or Tracking</h3>
        <p>
          We don't use any analytics SDKs, tracking pixels, or third-party cookies. We have no interest in
          monitoring how you or your kids use the app. There are no "events" sent to us when you play a video
          or add a playlist.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Remote Access (Optional)</h3>
        <p>
          If you choose to enable the optional "Remote Access" feature, the app uses a relay service to connect
          your phone to your TV when you're not on the same WiFi network. This relay acts as a secure "tunnel"
          and does not store any information, PINs, or video data. It simply passes requests between your devices.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Open Source Transparency</h3>
        <p>
          Because ParentApproved.tv is open source, our privacy claims can be verified by anyone. Every line of
          code is public and available for audit on GitHub.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>
          The app plays videos from YouTube™ using the NewPipeExtractor library. When you play a video, your TV
          connects directly to YouTube's servers to stream the content. No data about your viewing is shared with
          us during this process.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Children's Privacy (COPPA/GDPR-K)</h3>
        <p>
          As an app designed for families, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
          and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR-K) by collecting <strong>zero</strong> personal information
          from children or parents.
        </p>
