      <div class="section-headline">
        <h2>You know this story.</h2>
      </div>

      <p class="problem-intro">
        You&rsquo;re not anti-screen. You use screens strategically &mdash; to cook dinner, take a work call,
        or just breathe for 20 minutes. The problem isn&rsquo;t screen time. The problem is that YouTube
        and other video apps decide what your kid watches next &mdash; and you don&rsquo;t.
      </p>

      <div class="problem-cards">
        <div class="problem-card">
          <h3>&ldquo;He started on dinosaur videos.&rdquo;</h3>
          <p>
            Your kid starts watching a playlist you found. Ten minutes later: unboxing videos, then toy
            commercials, then something in a language you don&rsquo;t speak. You didn&rsquo;t pick any of it.
            The algorithm did.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem-card">
          <h3>&ldquo;I turned on parental controls.&rdquo;</h3>
          <p>
            You set up YouTube Kids. You turned on Restricted Mode. Your kid still saw something that made
            you grab the remote. 46% of parents report the same thing.

          <p>
            Autoplay. Recommended videos. A search bar she learned to use at age 4. The app is designed
            to keep her watching &mdash; not to stop when the playlist ends.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem-card">
          <h3>&ldquo;I left the room for five minutes.&rdquo;</h3>
          <p>
            You come back and he&rsquo;s watching a video with 40 million views that you&rsquo;d never
            have chosen. It autoplayed from something fine. You couldn&rsquo;t have prevented it without
            sitting next to him the whole time.

        <div class="problem-card">
          <h3>&ldquo;I found a great channel. Then he found the sidebar.&rdquo;</h3>
          <p>
            You bookmarked an educational channel. But the YouTube interface has recommendations, search,
            and &ldquo;related videos&rdquo; everywhere. Your careful curation lasted exactly one tap.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem-card">
          <h3>&ldquo;I feel guilty enough already.&rdquo;</h3>
          <p>
            You don&rsquo;t need another app telling you screens are bad. You already know the trade-offs.
            You&rsquo;re making the best call you can with the time and energy you have. You just want to
            pick which videos &mdash; and not worry about the rest.

        Nobody else should decide what your child watches.

              About 5 minutes. Download the app file, install it on your TV, scan a QR code with your phone,

              Yes. Installing apps outside the Play Store (&ldquo;sideloading&rdquo;) is a standard Android feature
              &mdash; it&rsquo;s how many popular apps like SmartTube are installed on Android TV. Our app is
              completely open-source, so you (or anyone you trust) can read every line of code on GitHub. The app
              doesn&rsquo;t collect personal data, doesn&rsquo;t require unusual permissions, and doesn&rsquo;t
              send information to any server unless you explicitly turn on Remote Access.

              Any device running Android TV with Android 7.0 or higher. We&rsquo;ve tested it on the

              Yes. Each person scans the QR code on the TV and enters the PIN from their own phone &mdash;
              parents, grandparents, babysitters, whoever you trust. Everyone gets their own bookmark to the
              dashboard. They can all add playlists, control playback, and see watch history. The TV is the
              single source of truth &mdash; everyone sees the same playlists and the same data.

              No. All data stays on your TV. Playlists, watch history, settings &mdash; everything is stored
              locally in a database on the TV itself. Nothing is sent to any cloud server. Nothing is tracked.
              There are no analytics, no cookies, no data collection of any kind. The app doesn&rsquo;t even

              Android TV launcher. That&rsquo;s an operating system limitation that no app can override.
              For a dedicated kids&rsquo; TV, you can set ParentApproved.tv as the default launcher

              The technology that plays videos occasionally needs updates when YouTube changes something
              on their end. When this happens, we release an updated version of the app. Sign up for email
              updates or watch the GitHub repository to get notified. These updates are usually quick
