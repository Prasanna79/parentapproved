              YouTube Kids uses an algorithm to decide what your kid can watch. Even in &ldquo;Approved Content

              takes a completely different approach: you paste playlist URLs, and your kid sees <strong>only</strong>
              those videos. No search bar, no recommendations, no algorithm, no ads. You have 100% control over
              every video that appears on the screen.

              You do. That&rsquo;s the whole point. We don&rsquo;t pick &ldquo;safe&rdquo; content. We don&rsquo;t
              filter or recommend. We don&rsquo;t use AI to decide what&rsquo;s appropriate. You pick the playlists.
              Your kids watch those playlists. Nobody knows your child better than you &mdash; and no algorithm
              or company should be making that decision for your family.

              Yes. Installing apps outside the Play Store (&ldquo;sideloading&rdquo;) is a standard Android feature
              &mdash; it&rsquo;s how many popular apps like SmartTube are installed on Android TV. Our app is
              completely open-source, so you (or anyone you trust) can read every line of code on GitHub. The app
              doesn&rsquo;t collect personal data, doesn&rsquo;t require unusual permissions, and doesn&rsquo;t
              send information to any server unless you explicitly turn on Remote Access.

              No. All data stays on your TV. Playlists, watch history, settings &mdash; everything is stored
              locally in a database on the TV itself. Nothing is sent to any cloud server. Nothing is tracked.
              There are no analytics, no cookies, no data collection of any kind. The app doesn&rsquo;t even

              and no way to browse anything you haven&rsquo;t added. The Back button returns to the playlist
              screen. The one thing we can&rsquo;t prevent: the Home button on the remote exits to the
              Android TV launcher. That&rsquo;s an operating system limitation that no app can override.
              For a dedicated kids&rsquo; TV, you can set ParentApproved.tv as the default launcher

              Yes &mdash; if you choose to turn it on. Go to Settings on the TV and enable Remote Access.
              Your TV connects to a lightweight relay, and your phone&rsquo;s dashboard works from anywhere.
              You can add playlists, check what&rsquo;s playing, pause playback &mdash; all from your phone
              at work, on the bus, wherever. The relay is free and runs as charityware. If you prefer to keep
              everything fully local, just leave Remote Access off &mdash; the app works completely over your
              home WiFi.

              The relay is a tiny open-source bridge that connects your phone to your TV when you&rsquo;re
              not on the same WiFi. It forwards your requests to the TV and sends responses back &mdash;
              that&rsquo;s all it does. It doesn&rsquo;t store playlists, videos, PINs, or watch history.
              Your TV is still the backend and all data stays in your TV&rsquo;s local database. The relay
              code is open-source too &mdash; you can audit it or even host your own.

              The TV needs internet to stream videos. But all your playlists and settings are stored locally
              on the TV &mdash; they survive reboots, power outages, and app updates. Nothing depends on
              a cloud service. If your internet goes out, the playlists are still there when it comes back.

              The technology that plays videos occasionally needs updates when YouTube changes something
              on their end. When this happens, we release an updated version of the app. Sign up for email
              updates or watch the GitHub repository to get notified. These updates are usually quick
              &mdash; download the new app file and install it over the old one.

              Yes. Each parent scans the QR code on the TV and enters the PIN from their own phone. They each
              get their own bookmark to the dashboard. Both parents can add playlists, control playback, and
              view watch history. The TV is the single source of truth &mdash; both see the same playlists
              and the same data.

              That&rsquo;s the plan. Right now the app works with YouTube&#8482; playlists. Support for other video
              URLs and sources is planned for a future version. The goal is to let you add any video from
              anywhere &mdash; not just YouTube.

              It means the app works &mdash; real families use it &mdash; but it&rsquo;s still being actively
              developed. You might hit rough edges. Some features (like daily time limits) aren&rsquo;t built
              yet. We&rsquo;re honest about what&rsquo;s done and what&rsquo;s not. Your feedback during the
              beta directly shapes what gets built next. If something doesn&rsquo;t work, tell us and we&rsquo;ll fix it.
