        <h2>In the age of infinite content,<br>who curates your child&rsquo;s mind?</h2>

      <p class="problem-intro">
        More videos are uploaded every hour than your child could watch in a lifetime. Algorithms decide
        what they see next &mdash; optimized for watch time, not for your child&rsquo;s wellbeing.
        The only person qualified to decide what your child watches is you.

          <p>
            More video is uploaded every minute than anyone could review. Algorithms fill the gap &mdash;
            but they optimize for engagement, not education. Not safety. Not your values.

              No. There&rsquo;s no account to create, no Google sign-in, and no login. Just install the app,
              scan the QR code with your phone, enter the PIN shown on the TV, and you&rsquo;re in. Paste a

              Yes. Installing apps outside the Play Store (&ldquo;sideloading&rdquo;) is a standard Android feature
              &mdash; it&rsquo;s how many popular apps like SmartTube are installed on Android TV. Our app is
              completely open-source, so you (or anyone you trust) can read every line of code on GitHub. The app
              doesn&rsquo;t collect personal data, doesn&rsquo;t require unusual permissions, and doesn&rsquo;t
              send information to any server unless you explicitly turn on Remote Access.

              Any device running Android TV with Android 7.0 or higher. We&rsquo;ve tested it on the
              Xiaomi Mi Box 4 (Android 9) and the Android TV emulator (Android 14). It also works on
              Chromecast with Google TV, NVIDIA Shield, and generic Android TV boxes. If your TV runs
              Android TV and is from the last few years, it should work.

              YouTube Kids uses an algorithm to decide what your kid can watch. Even in &ldquo;Approved Content
              Only&rdquo; mode, the setup is clunky and doesn&rsquo;t work well on TV devices. ParentApproved.tv
              takes a completely different approach: you paste playlist URLs, and your kid sees <strong>only</strong>
              those videos. No search bar, no recommendations, no algorithm, no ads. You have 100% control over
              every video that appears on the screen.

              You do. That&rsquo;s the whole point. We don&rsquo;t pick &ldquo;safe&rdquo; content. We don&rsquo;t
              filter or recommend. We don&rsquo;t use AI to decide what&rsquo;s appropriate. You choose the playlists.
              Your kids watch those playlists. Nobody knows your child better than you &mdash; and no algorithm
              or company should be making that decision for your family.

              Yes, really free. No catch. This is open-source software built by a parent who had the same problem
              you do. There&rsquo;s no company behind it, no investors, no business model. The code is on GitHub for

              parents, grandparents, babysitters, whoever you trust. Everyone gets their own bookmark to the

              locally in a database on the TV itself. Nothing is sent to any cloud server. Nothing is tracked.
              There are no analytics, no cookies, no data collection of any kind. The app doesn&rsquo;t even

              The technology that plays videos occasionally needs updates when YouTube changes something
              on their end. When this happens, we release an updated version of the app. Sign up for email
              updates or watch the GitHub repository to get notified. These updates are usually quick
              &mdash; download the new app file and install it over the old one.

              That&rsquo;s the plan. Right now the app works with YouTube&#8482; playlists. Support for other video
              URLs and sources is planned for a future version. The goal is to let you add any video from
              anywhere &mdash; not just YouTube.

              Yes &mdash; if you choose to turn it on. Go to Settings on the TV and enable Remote Access.
              Your dashboard then works from anywhere &mdash; work, the bus, wherever. The relay is free
              and runs as charityware. If you prefer to keep everything on your home WiFi, just leave

              Yes. The relay just connects your phone to your TV when you&rsquo;re not on the same WiFi.
              It passes requests through &mdash; that&rsquo;s all it does. It doesn&rsquo;t store playlists,
              videos, PINs, or watch history. Your TV is still in control and all data stays on it.
              The relay is open-source too, so anyone can verify this.

              Open source means every line of code is published online for anyone to read. You know apps
              like Firefox and VLC? Same idea. Nothing hidden, nothing secret. If we say &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t

              Yes. ParentApproved.tv has zero algorithm. There are no recommendations, no autoplay
              suggestions, and no content the parent didn&rsquo;t personally add. It plays your

              The safest approach is to choose every video yourself. ParentApproved.tv lets you do exactly
              that: paste YouTube&#8482; playlist URLs, and your kids watch only those videos on the TV.
              No search, no browse, no algorithm. The app is free, open-source, and keeps all data on your
              TV &mdash; nothing goes to the cloud. It works on any Android TV device.
